  "problem_statement": {
    "background": "During digital forensic investigations, UFDR reports obtained from seized digital devices contain huge amounts of data like chats, calls, images, and videos. Going through this manually takes a lot of time and delays finding important evidence. Investigating Officers need a tool that makes this data easy to search and use.",
    "description": "Build an AI-based agent that can ingest UFDRs and allow CIOs to run natural language queries (e.g., 'show me chat records containing crypto addresses' or 'list all communications with foreign numbers'). The tool should intelligently retrieve relevant data, highlight key findings, and generate easy-to-understand outputs without requiring the officer to have deep technical expertise. The tool should also be able to provide interconnectivity and linkages across other forensics data.",
    "expected_solution": "An AI based software solution that ingests UFDRs from forensic tools, provides a natural language query interface for IOs, generates easily readable reports of relevant results, and reduces the time taken to extract actionable insights from UFDRs."
